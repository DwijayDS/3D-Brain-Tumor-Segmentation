So in this version we multiply dice coefficient for each class with certain weight. this weight is reciprocal of the frequency of that class\n","\n","2. The problem of class imbalance still persists and dice coeff is more than 1. So i this version we have implemented a new dice coefficient function.\n","\n","\n","FUTURE:\n","\n","1.
